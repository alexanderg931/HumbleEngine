A Text-Based RPG Engine

Greetings! I am Grant, creator of this project. My goal with this project is to create a Text-Based RPG Engine, written in Java,
that allows a user to create a sequential Text-Based RPG using text files and special keywords within these files to invoke game events.

The project is licensed under the MIT License, and it's worth mentioning that the project is currently not complete, nor has any end-user functionality quite yet. For the time being, the project is mostly just the game engine API, which is currently in the process of being written.

The project aims to stay as close to the Model-View-Controller design paradigm as possible.
